# Hurricane Analysis
codeacademy project

**Overview**

This project analyzes data on Category 5 hurricanes, the most powerful hurricanes classified by wind speed. It involves writing Python functions to organize and manipulate hurricane data using lists, dictionaries, loops, and conditionals. 

**Features**

- Data Cleaning: Converts damage data from string format (e.g., '100M', '1.5B') into numerical values.

- Data Organization: Structures hurricane data into dictionaries for efficient retrieval and analysis.

- Hurricane Categorization: Groups hurricanes by year and calculates statistics on affected areas.

- Statistical Analysis:

  - Identifies the most frequently affected areas.

  - Finds the deadliest hurricane based on recorded fatalities.

  - Classifies hurricanes by mortality scale.


**Data Used**

The dataset includes the following attributes for each hurricane:

Name: The hurricane's name.

Month: The month it occurred.

Year: The year it occurred.

Maximum Sustained Wind (mph): The highest recorded wind speed.

Areas Affected: A list of regions impacted by the hurricane.

Damage (USD): The estimated cost of damages in millions or billions.

Deaths: The number of recorded fatalities.


**How to Run the Project**

Install Python (if not already installed).

Clone or download this repository.

Open the script in a Python environment.

Run the script to analyze the hurricane data.
